Coded using the Unicon Programming Language (http://unicon.sourceforge.net/)

Prerequisites:
(these steps aren't yet automated so you will have to do them manually).

You will need Ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/).
All three .exe's (ffmpeg.exe,ffplay.exe and ffprobe.exe) must be in the same folder as all AM .exe's (run.exe,amdo.exe and amas.exe).

You will need a folder called "elements".

You will need the three .png files (it might work without them but it will look weird).

You will need 8 .txt files named in this order:
t1.txt
t1s.txt
t2.txt
t2s.txt
t3.txt
t3s.txt
t4.txt
t4s.txt

Now you should be good to go :).

NOTE: This code is super prelim and buggy. It's a work in process so I will fix things ASAP.
